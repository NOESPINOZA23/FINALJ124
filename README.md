## Prominet Gender and Racial Disparities in the United States

### Story Pitch
Women of color continue to experience the most severe gender pay gap in the United States, a reality that reflects the effects of intersecting racial, ethnic, and gender biases that threaten the economic security of women and their families. Both women and underrepresented minorities in the United States have earned an increasing proportion of bachelor's degrees and other advanced degrees, yet there has not been a similar increase in patenting activity among these groups. The central problem is the continuing discrimination experienced by disadvantaged minorities and women at every stage of the innovation process, from the exposure and mentoring of children and youth in career fields to post-advancement educational barriers, and from discriminatory denials of patent applications to lack of opportunity. The stubborn resilience of the gender pay gap, coupled with intersecting racial bias in the workplace, means many women of color are perpetually underpaid, and these losses add up and grow over time. The combined effects of racism and gender discrimination, in particular on migrant, immigrant, indigenous, minority and marginalized women around the world, have had devastating consequences for their full enjoyment of equality and fundamental human rights both in the public as well as the private sphere.




Final project for Data Journalism. Five Questions will be answered through data analysis using Datawrapper and google sheets tools. 




1- What is the total poverty rate for females i neach state? and what is the state with the maximum females in poverty?

First, a pivot table need to be inserted. Then choose plug the names-states into the rows section. Second, plug the total females in poverty on the values section. The adjust the pivot to summarize the table by MAX numbers. This pivot table will give the MAXIMUM number as a total. This total is the state that has the maximum women inpoverty in the whole country. 









What is the largest poor population per race and in what state is it located?

A new sheet was insected to avoid confusion among other data factors. Then, I copied and paste the Key Id which are the state names in this case. Next, the Vloolup formula is used to drag the necessary columns for the analysis. All the race columns are needed, and total below poverty numbers. Calculate poverty rate per race by calculating the total poverty number with the total population per race.
