## Prominet Gender and Racial Disparities in the United States

## Story Pitch
Women of color continue to experience the most severe gender wage gap in the United States, a reality that reflects the effects of intersecting racial, ethnic, and gender biases that threaten the economic security of women and their families. Furthermore, women and disadvantaged monorities have earned an increasing proportion of bachelor's degrees and other advanced degrees, yet there has not been a similar increase in regulations in favor of these groups. The central problem is the continuing discrimination experienced by disadvantaged minorities and women at every stage of the innovation process, from the exposure and mentoring of children and youth in career fields to post-advancement educational barriers, and from discriminatory denials of patent applications to lack of opportunity. The stubborn resilience of the gender pay gap, coupled with intersecting racial bias in the workplace, means many women of color are perpetually underpaid, and these losses add up and grow over time. The combined effects of racism and gender discrimination, in particular on migrant, immigrant, indigenous, minority and marginalized women have had devastating consequences for their full enjoyment of equality and fundamental human rights both in the public as well as the private sphere.
